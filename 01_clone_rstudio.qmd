# Troubleshooting {.unnumbered}

-   **Authentication failed:** RStudio may prompt you for GitHub credentials. If using HTTPS, you must enter a personal access token (PAT) instead of your password. You can create one at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.

-   **Git not configured in RStudio:** If Git is not detected, go to **Tools \> Global Options \> Git/SVN** and set the path to your Git executable (usually `git.exe`).

-   **Missing Git option in New Project menu:** Install Git for Windows or macOS and restart RStudio.

-   **Project wonâ€™t open or clone fails:** Double-check the URL and ensure that you selected the correct folder and have internet access.
