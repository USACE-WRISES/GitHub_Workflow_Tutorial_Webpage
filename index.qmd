# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to **GitHub Workflow Skill Building**, a practical tutorial designed to help you develop confidence using Git and GitHub through real-world tasks. Whether you're an independent researcher, student, or team collaborator, this guide will help you navigate version control effectively using tools like **Git GUI**, **VSCode**, and **RStudio**.

This book walks you through the GitHub workflow step-by-step, with separate chapters for each tool and task. You'll learn not just the "how," but also the "why" behind key practices in collaborative version control.

**In these pages, you’ll learn how to:**

-   **Clone** repositories using the browser, **Git GUI**, **VSCode**, and **RStudio**

-   **Create** new local repositories and connect them to GitHub

-   **Fork** other people’s projects and contribute using pull requests

-   **Resolve** version conflicts and recover lost or stashed changes

-   **Troubleshoot** common problems with Git and GitHub

-   **Maintain** a healthy repository through everyday best practices

Each chapter is structured around learning objectives, visual instructions, video walkthroughs, and clear troubleshooting tips. You’ll find code snippets and guidance tailored to the platform you prefer to work in, whether you're coding in R, Python, or just managing documentation.

**By the end of this book, you’ll be able to:**

-   Start and maintain your own GitHub repositories

-   Confidently contribute to others’ projects using forks and branches

-   Prevent and resolve version issues

-   Use GitHub to support reproducible, collaborative, and well-documented work

### About the Author {.unnumbered}

I am an ecological modeler with a focus on aquatic ecosystems, collaborative science, and accessible tools for interdisciplinary work. I created this tutorial to support learners from all backgrounds, whether you are new to version control or looking to build confidence across different platforms. My goal is to make GitHub feel approachable and useful, especially for those working in research, data analysis, or team-based projects. I regularly use Git, R, and Python in my own workflows and hope this guide helps you feel more empowered in yours.
