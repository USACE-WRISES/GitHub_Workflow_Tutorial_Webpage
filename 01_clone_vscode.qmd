-   **Authentication failed:** If prompted for login credentials, use a personal access token (PAT) instead of a password. Generate one at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.

-   **Git not installed:** Make sure Git is installed on your computer and that VSCode can detect it. You can download Git from <https://git-scm.com>.
