# Troubleshooting {.unnumbered}

-   **Authentication failed:** Git GUI may still ask for a GitHub username and password, which no longer work with HTTPS. Use a personal access token (PAT) instead. You can generate one at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.

-   **Nothing happens after cloning:** Double-check the Source URL and make sure it’s spelled correctly. Also, confirm that the folder you selected as the Target Directory is empty or available.

-   **Can’t see the files in File Explorer:** Git GUI only manages version control. You’ll need to open the folder using your file browser or another tool like VSCode to view and edit files.
