# What Are Common GitHub Problems? {.unnumbered}

Even experienced users encounter problems when working with Git and GitHub. These issues usually occur during setup, collaboration, or when switching between tools like RStudio, VSCode, and Git GUI.

# When Do These Problems Occur? {.unnumbered}

-   Pushing changes without proper authentication

-   Pulling updates when your local files have diverged

-   Conflicting file versions due to multiple contributors

-   Forgetting to stage, commit, or sync your changes

-   Not configuring Git properly the first time

# Step-by-Step Guide to Fix Common Issues {.unnumbered}

### Problem 1: Authentication Failed {.unnumbered}

**What it looks like:** You’re prompted for a password, but login fails.\
**Why it happens:** GitHub no longer supports password authentication for HTTPS.

**Solution:**

1.  Generate a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

2.  Use the token in place of your GitHub password when prompted.

3.  Consider using an SSH key for future sessions (especially in VSCode).

### Problem 2: Repo Exists on GitHub, But Push Fails {.unnumbered}

**What it looks like:** You get an error saying remote repository not found or push is rejected.\
**Why it happens:** The GitHub repo is initialized with a README or other files that conflict with your local setup.

**Solution:**

1.  When creating the repo on GitHub, do not initialize with README, license, or .gitignore.

2.  If conflicts exist, pull first:

    ```         
    git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
    ```

3.  Resolve any conflicts, then push.

### Problem 3: Git Not Detected {.unnumbered}

**What it looks like:** Git features are missing in RStudio or VSCode.\
**Why it happens:** Git is not installed or not properly linked to your IDE.

**Solution:**

1.  Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).

2.  Restart your IDE.

3.  In RStudio: Go to **Tools \> Global Options \> Git/SVN** and verify the Git executable path.

4.  In VSCode: Git should be detected automatically. If not, check your system path.

### Problem 4: Changes Aren’t Showing on GitHub {.unnumbered}

**What it looks like:** You committed locally, but nothing appears in your GitHub repo.\
**Why it happens:** You forgot to push your changes.

**Solution:**

1.  After committing, push using:

    ```         
    git push origin main
    ```

2.  Refresh the GitHub page to confirm.

### Problem 5: You Cloned the Wrong Repo or Fork {.unnumbered}

**What it looks like:** You're editing a repo, but you can't push changes.\
**Why it happens:** You cloned the original repo instead of your fork.

**Solution:**

1.  Fork the original repository on GitHub.

2.  Clone your fork, not the original project.

3.  Confirm your remote URL with:

    ```         
    git remote -v
    ```

# Tool-Specific Tips {.unnumbered}

### RStudio {.unnumbered}

-   Use the Git tab to commit and push

-   If Git tab is missing, configure Git in **Tools \> Global Options \> Git/SVN**

### VSCode {.unnumbered}

-   Use the Source Control tab

-   Look for inline errors or tooltips when actions fail

### Git GUI {.unnumbered}

-   Use “Rescan” and “Push” manually

-   Add remote via **Remote \> Add**

# Summary {.unnumbered}

| Problem | Fix |
|----|----|
| Authentication fails | Use PAT or set up SSH |
| Push fails due to README conflict | Don’t initialize GitHub repo with README |
| Git not recognized | Install Git and restart IDE |
| Can’t push changes | Make sure you're on the correct branch and have committed |
| Wrong repo cloned | Confirm remote URL matches your GitHub fork |
