-   Learn effective practices for managing changes in GitHub repositories

-   Apply consistent workflows for using Git across different platforms

# Why Do Best Practices Matter? {.unnumbered}

Using Git and GitHub effectively is more than just committing and pushing code. It involves managing your repository in a way that keeps it organized, understandable, and collaborative. These practices apply whether you are working alone or with a team.

# Daily Workflow Best Practices {.unnumbered}

### 1. **Pull Before You Start** {.unnumbered}

Always begin your work session by pulling the latest changes:

```         
git pull
```

This ensures your local files are up-to-date with the remote repository and helps avoid merge conflicts later.

### 2. **Use Meaningful Commit Messages** {.unnumbered}

Each commit should explain what and why you made changes:

```         
git commit -m "Fix typo in data summary and update README"
```

Avoid vague messages like "update" or "fix."

### 3. **Push Before You Leave** {.unnumbered}

Before ending your work session, commit any final changes and push to GitHub:

```         
git add . git commit -m "Wrap up session and push changes" git push
```

This keeps your work synced and backed up in the remote repository.

# Organizational Practices {.unnumbered}

-   **Use a clear README**: Include instructions for how to run the project, data sources, dependencies, and project purpose.

-   **Maintain file structure**: Use directories (e.g., `/data`, `/scripts`, `/docs`) to keep files organized.

-   **Document dependencies**: Use `requirements.txt` (Python) or `DESCRIPTION` (R) to list required packages.

-   **Use issues and pull requests**: Track bugs, suggestions, and feature development using GitHub Issues. Use Pull Requests (PRs) to review and integrate changes.

# Collaboration Tips {.unnumbered}

-   **Branch for Features or Fixes**: Create a new branch for each major feature or change:

    ```         
    git checkout -b feature-login-form
    ```

-   **Review Before Merge**: Always review changes in a Pull Request before merging into `main` or `master`. Leave comments and suggestions when working with others.

-   **Avoid Committing Sensitive Files**: Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude data files, credentials, or temporary files that shouldnâ€™t be tracked.

By following these habits, you can prevent conflicts, improve collaboration, and make your GitHub projects easier to maintain over time.
